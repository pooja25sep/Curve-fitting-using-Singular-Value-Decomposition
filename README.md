# Linear-Systems-and-Curve-Fitting

* Implemented C++ algorithms for solving underdetermined and overdetermined systems of equations
and applied to curve fitting for optimal parameter estimation.
* Developed C++ code for Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to carry out matrix rank
approximation & finding condition number.
